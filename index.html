                    My name is Baran Emre Uysal (S3901499), and I'm Turkish, I speak a medium amount, but understand a fair bit more. I am fresh outta highschool and studying First year in bachelors of IT. My birthday is on Feb 5th 2003, which means i'm 18. I graduated from Westall secondary college as school captain in 2020., and it was a pretty fun year. The hobbies I have are gaming, coding, sleeping and eating. I play mostly league of legends, which is ruining my life, but I’m always keen to try new games. I know the bare minimum on coding, but I find it interesting and fun. My interests in IT are security, i really like the aspect of keeping data safe and making sure there are no intrusions in your system. My IT experiences are working in retail at a computer store for 5 days, and spending countless amounts of hours on my computer fixing issues here and there.

I graduated from Killester College in 2020, and am in my first year of RMIT studying a bachelor of Information Technology. My hobbies consist of the occasional tetris match or a classic novel. Despite those being my hobbies, I spend most of my time going out with friends or looking after my younger brother. I haven’t always been interested in I.T but more recently I’ve really enjoyed learning more about it and delving into the world of I.T. I have little to no experience in it however. My sister is currently doing I.T so I have been exposed to it prior my interest and I had decided to do I.T in VCE which i enjoyed and has lead me here to this course.

                    Derek:
                    Hi, my name is Derek TEK (s3856456). I was born in Melbourne, Australia, and was raised by a Cambodian family who migrated to Australia during the Khmer rouge. My birthday is 19 March 2002, and I am currently 19. I attended Westall Secondary College in 2018 and graduated in 2019. I am currently studying a bachelor’s degree of Information Technology at RMIT as of 2021. My hobbies consist of gaming and gym which I spend most of my free time doing as well as building pc hardware for my friends which is my favourite thing to do however it is a costly hobby. Growing up I have always been around technology, whether it would be at home or school, I was always interacting with a device. The initial interest was sparked when my father introduced his laptop back in 2006, it intrigued and perplexed my views on what was possible. Through a glass panel, whatever interests and questions I personally had, were answered through the device. If I required music or just some cartoons to watch, it was all on the screen. Therefore, I would be interested in learning to create software and programs, to contribute my fair share and to invoke interest in others, just as I was initially inspired.

I was born in Australia and am half Vietnamese and Australian, my mother migrated here during the Vietnam War and my father was born here with Irish/English heritage. In my spare time I love to play cricket, cook and hang out with friends. My interest in IT started from a young age, playing computer games and building computers with my older brother. I fell in love with the imagination that could exist from a computer and how engaging this new world became. I've continued this passion for IT and want to continue to develope it further. I haven't had a career in IT as of yet, but have worked closely with IT departments on issues experienced. Although at home if there is any technology issues, then im the person to call in to try and fix it.

I graduated from Melton Secondary College in 2020 I am currently a student at RMIT university studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I am fluent in Punjabi and Hindi. I enjoy soccer and music. I liked video games since childhood and wanted to create one myself one day. I got interested in coding at school when I first started learning python in Year 10. Soon after I made my first game (mostly copied code from internet) and it felt easy, so I decided to do something related to IT after graduation. In year 12 we had to make a very complicated software and I spent hours at home trying to find solutions to problems in my code prioritising it over other important subjects. I also got interested in programming languages used to create games like C++ and wished to learn it. I was determined to either create games or become an ethical hacker.

                <h3>Group Processes</h3>
                <p>Shortly after finalising and submitting our assignment 2 project, I presumed that our group did an amazing job. However, after receiving the grades, I was not as pleased as the score we got did not meet my expectations. The initial plan was that everyone was assigned an equal amount of work which was to be completed a day prior to the due date as the final day was for proofreading and to put everything onto a website. I believe that we have followed our plan very well as everyone was able to contribute the same amount of work and effort into what has been assigned to them and to have them completed a day prior to its due date. Although we were able to follow our plans, our work did not meet the exact criteria we thought we were going to achieve. In response to this, for our assignment 3 we will be doing some minor changes to prevent the same thing from happening in assignment 2. Just like the previous assignment, we will be distributing an equal amount of work to every individual in our group which is to be completed a day prior to the due date. Then for the final day, I (Derek) will be proof reading everything and comparing them to the rubric highlighted under the assignment to achieve the best marks that we could possibly receive. After everything has been approved by me, I would hand over the final word document over to Baran as he is in charge of setting up the website. Other than the differences that I have highlighted, everything else should remain the same for everyone to follow.

                <h3>Career Plans</h3>
                <div style="padding: 20px;">
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">Derek – Software engineer
                  This position facilitates all the stages during the development of software. Employees are required to utilise their technical skills to make products that stakeholders require. Examples of this are programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and C++. The reason that this career prospect interests me is because technology is always changing, and software engineers must adapt to this change to maintain their strength and position within the industry. Another reason as to why I would like to work in this field in the future is because it is not physically demanding and hence would allow me to work for longer. From what’s highlighted in Steven’s career plans, because his ideal job is a software engineer, we have similar career plans which is essentially developing software’s for companies. The other jobs listed by other team members are all part of the IT field, however they share different elements. My job is specifically for working on creating a whole new software whereas the others are more of working around applications or hardware.
                  <br>
                </div>
                <div style="padding: 20px;">
                  Jessica – IT coordinator
                  This job entails having to manage and update databases and provide a solid support system for the team. This job appeals to me because I believe this work is so necessary for all organisations and such an overlooked job, I find networking and databases immensely interesting and would love to find a career in it. The other jobs that has been highlighted by others share no similarities with mine whatsoever. This is due to my job being more to do with updating databases into the system.
                  <br>

                <div style="padding: 20px;">
                  Baran – Cyber security specialist
                  My goal to get to the necessary skills to be hired for a job like this is to learn from my course, take every security elective offered, and if there are none left, take software development courses. After my course I will search for graduate level jobs in security, and gain experience from there. This job, cyber security specialist, would be a dream job for me as the person who can fit this role of work requires a deep understanding of security. they understand how things work and how things can be broken down, and how to avoid things from going south. The position advertised is a government client, most likely requiring the worker to keep quiet about what they do, which sounds awesome. Having a job where u can’t tell people what you do? Sign me up. It pays well and can allow access to higher ranks from the department, getting paid even more. Some skills i have now are the bare bone basics of Linux, an understanding of networks and network systems, a passion for computers and security, and a decent understanding of security. Nowhere near the level they ask for here. My goal to get to the necessary skills to be hired for a job like this is to learn from my course, take every security elective offered, and if there are none left, take software development courses. After my course I will search for graduate level jobs in security, and gain experience from there.

                <div style="padding: 20px;">
                  Manan – Ethical Hacker
                  I want to become an ethical hacker because I find it exciting to breach a software’s security by attacking weaknesses and then come up with measures to make the software more secure. Hackers need to learn a range of programming languages and have strong SQL skills. The payrate for hackers in good and they can work internationally very easily. Being a hacker means always improving your skills. Hackers frequently practice in virtual environments and must learn many languages. A similar career plan to my job in terms of concept is Baran’s job as he would like to become a cyber security specialist. Although they share the same concept with one another, they are different due to one being on the defensive side of things and another being on the offence. Other than that, every other job listed are different from mine.

                <h4>Topic</h4>
                <div style="padding: 10px;">
                  <p>For our project, we plan on developing a smart application that generates delicious and nutritious recipes for consumer desires. Within the app there will be various functions and usages such as evaluating the nutritional values of various foods and ingredients which creates recipes that strive to help users that will cater to achieve their nutritional and dietary goals. The end user will be provided a daily report which showcases the amount of nutrition consumed per day such as, calorie intake, carbs, protein, and fat etc.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div style="padding: 10px;">
                  <p>We plan to establish this app using appypie.com, which requires no knowledge in programming whatsoever. Since this is a group project, we will all be splitting off the tasks so that everyone gets assigned an equal amount of work which is to be completed through a shared document on Google Docs. We will also have our own discussion page on Discord so that we are able to communicate and help each other progress efficiently.  It is important that before this app begins its initial stages of development, we must conduct a thorough research to be able to make further progresses. We may need to research and analyse some statistics as to what users would prefer to be incorporated in the app. This can be achieved by looking at reviews of similar products on the market as there will be common errors reported that we could prevent from happening. Professional dieticians and chef’s advice may also be an essential human resource as they are able to provide more in-depth information about each recipe.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div style="padding: 10px;">
                  <p>We plan to release the app on IOS and android platforms as well as a website that includes the same features as the mobile devices. By releasing the app on a variety of commonly used platforms, it helps us to garner a larger number of users in contrast to only releasing it on a single platform. If this project is successful, it will provide many long-term implications such as developing good habits which serves to diminish poor dietary habits. Furthermore, this app serves an educational purpose which allows users to be more mindful with their food sustainability. We could also implement a user feedback mechanism which allows for further improvements and tweaks.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p> Some point in our lives, we have all heard how unappetising and bland eating healthy can be. Due to this reason being one factor as to why people are not inclined to having a healthy diet, developing an app that is designed to generate recipes that provides meals with high amounts of nutrition with such rich taste in its flavour, it allows those who have trouble eating healthy due to its boring and undesirable taste. This app is an important as it helps to cater unhealthy dietary habits as it will provide many long-term implications such as developing good habits which serves to diminish poor dietary habits. Furthermore, this app serves an educational purpose which allows users to be more mindful with their food sustainability. We believe that by developing this application, it would allow us to demonstrate to future employers of what we can create. There will be skills that we may have acquired from working on this project that we could potentially put into use working for my new employer. One skill is the ability to work as a group as this can be an essential skill that is required as it involves a lot of communication such as setting a different task to each member in the group. It also allows everyone to share our ideas and view them from different perspectives, hence allowing us to go into greater depths in terms of creativity and ideas in contrast to working alone.

                  <p>
                  A similar product that is currently available to the public is the app called supercook which was developed by AMR Systems LLC. Available to download on various platforms including, IOS and android, the app is rated at 4.8 stars and 4.5 stars respectively and is also easily accessible via the browser. From our group’s perspective, this company can be viewed as a competitor simply because of the similar aspects that both our apps share. When launching the app for the first time, we are presented with a beautifully designed user interface that runs relatively smooth and is easy to navigate which enriches the user experience. A similar concept that AMR Systems LLC has incorporated in their app is that it gives users the ability to select a list of ingredients that they own which is categorised neatly into their own category (vegetables, meats, fishes, dairy, spices, etc.). Although the concepts are similar in their own unique way, a feature that this app doesn’t have is the ability to display the amount of nutrition under each recipe. This will provide the users specifically what they are consuming as well as the nutrition that is provided in each meal which in contrast to this, supercook does not offer this feature, giving a higher chance of unhealthy dietary consumption over time as they are unaware of what is being consumed. Our team believes that this is an essential feature to be incorporated in every cooking app as it allows the users to be informed about the health benefits they can get with each meal and thus promote a healthier lifestyle.<br>

                 <h2>Testing </h3>
                  <p>Testing of this app would be a continuous task that is allocated throughout the project. We want to ensure that the launch of the project is successful and doesn’t have any issues that could have been prevented through the development of the app. 

                     <br>There would be 2 core testing teams, developers and controlled-users. 

                     <br>Developers would ensure there are no issues with the functionality and content of the app. The testing plan will include scripts to be followed and suggestions of different potential user input. The key focus would be testing if all links/buttons are linked to the right pages, the content provided provides the correct content and the back-end coding causes no issues and is consistent throughout. The content would be reviewed and ensured that it is up to date. 

                     <br>Controlled-User testing would be focused on the app’s usability and content to determine whether the app is effective in its goal. We would want to have at least 10 people using the app daily in their normal day to day life with feedback sessions starting with once a week and then moving towards fortnightly feedback sessions. This is to continue improvements to the app and address any issues that may arise. We would also want to bring in new users to test out the app throughout the development stage to ensure that the first experience of using the app is engaging, and encourages the continued use of the app. 

                     <br>The more testing that is provided throughout will increase the change of success of the app. The constant feedback would allow our team to plan and design new components that can be introduced to build the best possible app. If there are still issues that impact users negatively or the app’s content is not useful to our users then the app would be a failure. We want to ensure that the app’s goal is reached and the user experience is smooth.

                <h2>Aims</h2>
                  <p>The aim of our project is to make it easier for people to cook their own meals and eat healthier. There's nothing worse than the feeling of knowing you have ingredients in the house, but not knowing how to cook or what to make. So, the goal of our project was to allow people with low cooking skills to make amazing food easily and help them pay attention to their diet.

                <h2>Risks</h2>
                  <p>Risks for the project could be the difficulty in making something that works. There are a lot of ways to approach the project, some that can take the easy route or the hard route. However, using Figma to make the prototype of the project allows for an easy visualization of the final project. If we were to be making the real project however, algorithms with certain recipes and coding the application would be the biggest risk factor, as we do not really know how to do that kinda stuff.

                <h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
                  <p>Our group communicated with predominantly discord, as attempts with other forms of communication such as Microsoft teams, we were faced with problems. Mainly one of our group members microphones not working on teams but working fine on discord. If team members did not respond to the communication call, we simply included their possible input into our conversations, and considered their schedule and when they did eventually respond, someone from the group would fill them in on the tasks at hand and bring them up to speed.

                <h2>scope and limits</h2>
                  <p>The project revolves around developing an application that can generate recipes depending on the customer’s ingredients and wishes. There will be many features that our team wish to include such as the recipes, nutritional trackers, and a daily report amongst other things. The main limitation that we face is time, due to the set amount of time allocated for the project we are unable to develop a fully functional application. Figma is the website we are using to develop our application prototype - Figma itself has limitations which will prevent us from implementing certain aspects. Such features such as an ingredient filter cannot be fully fleshed out as it wouldn’t be possible to add every single ingredient and create a functional system that would result in allowing the customer to see all possible recipes and combinations they can make. The daily report is a feature that includes tracking the user’s nutritional health - and their intake of certain food categories. This will not be made accurately as both Figma and our time strain prevents us from doing so. Our application as a whole will also not be completely functional - not every button will lead to something. Our goal is to create a functional prototype in the time limit using the tools given to us.

                <h2>tools and technologies </h2>
                  <p>The main tool being used to design and develop our application is Figma, a browser site. A few of our members have slight experience in using the website and it in itself is easy to grasp and learn how to use making it so every member can partake in the building of the app.

                <h2>Progress and Plans</h2>
                  <p>The projects’ main goal is to allow people to eat healthier and keep track of their health without having to think twice. The app has a database of recipes that is stored on a separate server; however, the saved recipes tab is downloaded onto the storage of the device. Meaning that even if the user has no internet access, they can cook their favorite recipes. The app started off as just an idea that was written down, but as time went on, we began designing the application and getting that design down on Figma. The very first feature that was developed was a recipe, it used icons that were made in MS Paint, and it looked horrid. But as time went on and new designs were added, the application framework looks like how it looks now. The plan was to make the wireframe in Figma, have a couple features and make it look clean. It ended up having a few features, and still looking clean. The application still could have had a few more features and looked cleaner. But for the time that was given, the application looks great. The progress for the project started on the 19-05-2021, with the recipe page. The features were also listed down. On the 22nd, icons made in MS Paint were thrown on as a baseline idea for what was needed. These icons were for the navigation bar down the bottom and provided a guideline on the features needed. On the 25th, new, more modern icons were implemented onto the single recipe page. These replaced the ones that were made in MS Paint. On the 26th, Derek Tek, a member of Group Merge, provided the team with hand drawn designs of the application, and the team got to work. 27th, the home page was done, being the pantry feature and so on. and the food tracker was done, 28th 4 recipes and new icons once again were added that looked even nicer than the ones before. 29th the last feature was finished, being the saved recipe page. On the last day before the due date, the 30th, the profile page was made, and a few new recipes were added. Derek making those designs on paper really kick started the progress for the project and allowed everyone in the group to do their own part. Everyone specialized in something while making the wireframe. Baran Uysal made the baselines for all the features, Steve Mc Allister chose the layout and colour scheme, while Jessica Vu made everything look perfect.

                  <br>When planning and implementing the design element of the app,w e wanted to maintain consistency throughout the app with its aesthetics and usability. Having a clear contrast of buttons to allow users to recognise information and navigation easily without any confusion.
                  <br>The taskbar at the bottom of the screen is to ensure that the user is able to move to different aspects of the app without getting in the way of the information provided on the page. We wanted to keep the design of the buttons to be recognisable at a glance so the user can become familiar and navigate throughout the app with ease.
                  <br>We’ve tried to keep each page minimalistic with contrasting colours to allow the user's attention to be focused on the information that’s presented to them. Using colours that encourage a calming and happy mood.
                  <br>We have also focused on the presentation of food in our app to be the most salivating as possible for our users, each photo really draws the user into wanting to discover more of how they can start to eat that. We want the food aspect to be exciting and the forefront of the design due to it being core values of htre apps success.


                  <br>The saved recipe feature contains recipes that the user decides to save. It allows for the user to find their favorite recipes with ease and allows them to save new ones also. Each of the saved recipes will be downloaded to the phone’s storage, allowing for use without needing internet access.
                  <br>The home page has 3 pages, one showing the ingredients that you have in your pantry called “pantry”, another one that shows you recipes that you can make based off ingredients in your pantry, called “Just for you”, The last page is the search page, allowing for the user to search for recipes. There is a filter button that allows the user to remove or add certain ingredients that they want in their recipe. Such as chicken, beef, tofu, pork etc. this feature makes it very easy for the user to find what they want to eat. If they have an eating restriction such as being allergic to peanuts, then the application allows for no peanut recipes to come up in the search area.
                  <br>The food tracker page allows for users to track their food intake, such as carbs, protein, fats, and kilojoules. The tracker will collect data from the recipes that they have cooked. Based on the daily intake, recipes may be recommended on the homepage to increase a certain statistic, such as protein or carbs. Assisting the user in becoming a healthier person and making their life easier.
                  <br>the profile page will consist of settings that can help customize the application to the users needs, such as food allergies to stop recipes with certain ingredients coming up in the home page, but still allowing it to come up in the search page just in case they need to cook for someone else, or some other person is using the application. It also allows them to choose what type of food they would like to see, such as healthy food to lose weight.
                  <br>The recipe pages all consist of cooking time, prep time, ingredients, and recipe. Making it easy for the user to tell how long the recipe will take and what they need to make the recipe. The recipe page shows an image of the food as a thumbnail for what the user is about to make, helping them decide if that is the right meal for them at that time.
